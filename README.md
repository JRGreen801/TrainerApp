# TrainerApp

The Trainer App loads its input from two seperate public Google Sheets in CSV format and pushes via a Google AppScipt to extend a row in the fitting format to the Google Sheets.

The RunnerData and FeedbackData sheets were seperated because they are public, so full names and Feedback are seperated. So Feedback is only linked whith the PN/PW number.

This Project is still in Development.
--> The release folder you can find a stable build .apk.
